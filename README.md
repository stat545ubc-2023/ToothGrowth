# ToothGrowth App

This app allows the user to explore the _Tooth Growth_ data set. This dataset (built-into R) includes the length in milimeters of teeth in 10 guinea pigs at three Vitamin C dosage levels (0.5, 1, or 2 mg), given one of two supplements (orange juice or ascorbic acid). The complete dataset contains 60 observations and 3 columns: 
- `len`: Tooth length (mm)
- `supp`: Categorical (OJ or VC)
- `dose`: Vitamin C dosage (mg)

## Features
In addition to features established in BC Liquor App developed in Dean Attaliâ€™s tutorial, the following attributes are implemented in the ToothGrowth App. 
1. Theme selector allows users to choose an theme most desirable to them.
2. A checkbox group allows users to select levels of supplements to be displayed (OJ and/or VC).
3. Tabs are implemented to further organize the interface for simplicity. 
4. The summary table provides users with a numerical summary of the data after filtering from slider and checkbox is applied.
5. The DT package is used to produce an interactive data table. This produces an organized display of data and allows for user interactivity. 

## Acknowledgments
The foundation of this app was originally developed using Dean Attali's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB4SJGyaGls&themeRefresh=1). Additionally features were inspired from recommendations from the Assignment B-3 page.
